# The IRS is now charging 8% on quarterly taxes for side hustles like Uber as of Oct 1st because of the Fed raing its rates

The deadline to pay estimated taxes for the final quarter of 2023 is January 15, however, if you file your 2023 tax return by January 31 and pay all taxes you owe for the year, that deadline does not apply.

Estimated taxes can be paid through the IRS website at IRS.gov.
