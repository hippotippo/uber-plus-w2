# The IRS is now charging 8% on quarterly taxes for side hustles like Uber as of Oct 1st because of the Fed raising its rates over the past year

The deadline to pay estimated taxes for the final quarter of 2023 is January 15, however, if you file your 2023 tax return by January 31 and pay all taxes you owe for the year, that deadline does not apply.

# Making $1000 on your side hustle after taxes will cost you $100 
If you wait until April 15th to pay your taxes you are out of compliance and will have to pay a penalty on the income earned. Interest is accrued daily with the IRS!!
Even if the IRS will owe you money at tax time for your side hustle it is better to make a $20 estimated payment rather than get penalized for $5000 of income on April 15th


Estimated taxes can be paid via mail or online
